I've just begun learning the Python coding language, and I thought I'd post my progress here. That will give me a good reason to try and keep the code tidy and readable to others.

I'm using the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes to study with, so much of the scripts will be based on tasks directly from that book. Hopefully as I progress, the scripts should become better and more advanced.
